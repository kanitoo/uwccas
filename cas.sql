This program is based on the belief that answers to health problems can be found locally, looking within, rather than waiting for solutions from the outside. \r\nPSBH is a process that challenges individuals to rethink problems impacting their lives and their role in solving them. This approach invites active participation and demonstrates how local people can organize themselves in collective, participatory, and constructive ways to solve immediate problems, influence public policy, and strive for better conditions of life no matter where they live. \r\nPSBH workshops and trainings have been implemented in more than 30 countries with 60,000 participants, inspiring 45,000 individual projects to improve health.\r\n\r\nThe Process \r\nWorkshop training: Participants learn a 5-step framework over the course of a 1-2 day workshop:\r\n	1. Defining the problem\r\n	2. Prioritizing the problem \r\n	3. Defining a solution \r\n	4. Creating an action plan \r\n	5. Taking action\r\n\r\nOutcomes\r\nLocal PSBH projects can start from the smallest seed – one person with one simple idea and a commitment to taking action to solve a problem, or can grow from collaborative efforts. Examples of successful PSBH projects include: \r\nA diabetes club in Fujian Provincial Hospital in China that brings participants together to work on diet management, medication management, and blood glucose monitoring \r\nAn annual fitness and nutrition summer camp for youth in Clarksdale, MS\r\nHealthy Nurse- Healthy People program developed to promote exercise and better nutrition among healthcare providers and their families in the U.S. Affiliated Pacific Islands\r\n\r\nAbout DHPRC\r\nDreyfus Health Policy and Research Center (DHPRC) is a 501c3 not-for-profit organization. \r\nAlthough independent, we will be working in close affiliation with Dialysis Clinic, Inc. (DCI), the largest non-profit dialysis provider in the United States. DCI currently cares for more than 15,000 people on dialysis in 28 states, provides acute kidney care in 147 hospitals and has been doing so for 49 years. We also share the conviction that an emphasis should be\r\nplaced on the prevention of kidney disease (including the frequently associated preconditions\r\nof obesity, diabetes, and hypertension), early detection and appropriate intervention, as well as slowing the progression of established chronic diseases.\r\nPSBH is a program of DHPRC . We believe that working in partnership with people at the grassroots level can achieve better health outcomes for communities, regions, nations, and the world. \r\n','active',1,'2020-09-09 10:16:43',0,NULL,'00:00:00','00:00:00','00:00:00','00:00:00','00:00:00','00:00:00','00:00:00'),(47,45,NULL,'Leadership school - Dilijan Community Centre','Leadership-school---Dilijan-Community-Centre','The DCC Leadership School will be a 4-month long leadership-focused training session which will consist of training for youth around decision-making skills, self-awareness building, identifying strengths and weaknesses, public speaking skills, critical thinking skills, communication, and more.

In the CAS, we go through art therapy exercises that use different mediums to explore a part of ourselves, whether that be trauma, stress, or the day-to-day ennui that is tangling and trapping us, and express that through art. All too often do we find ourselves overwhelmed with academic schoolwork, social life, and trying to find a balance between all this. The CAS is a reflection of ourselves and a chance to be introspective; we can reflect on mistakes and use the strength of art and our creativity to get up again, which is a very healthy coping mechanism.
